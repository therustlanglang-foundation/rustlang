# The Book Of Rustlang Developed By The Members of github.com/therustlanglang-foundation (VERSION 3 (EVEN MORE REVISED))
## CH. 0 - WHO WE ARE AS THERUSTLANGLANG FOUNDATION
We are legally distinct from "Rust" &mdash; a """language""".

## CH. 1 - THE *CONCEPT*, THE LEGEND
Everyone knows that Rustlang is the greatest programming *concept* in the world (yes, *concept* &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; we'll delve into that later). One may even describe it as "legendary". This book will define what Rustlang "is", or "was" as a programming *concept*. Perhaps we may even delve into "how" Rustlang "is" a programming *concept*. Maybe even "where" Rustlang "could" "be" as "a" "programming" *concept*.

## CH. 2 - THE RULES
- Rustlang is NOT Go or Rust. 
- It is not a programming *language*, rather a programming *concept*.
- To program in Rustlang is to commit your lifestyle to Rustlang. No one "uses" Rustlang, rather it uses YOU.
- Rustlang was invented by the great Charlie "**Chat**" **G**erald **P**erry **T**homas. He so declared; I closed the tab. I'm too lazy to quote him. You'll just have to guess.
- You can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in &mdash; Rustlang &mdash; becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you 
- The book is not a "teaching" book. I am not here to "teach" you Rustlang. This is a spiritual book. You must engage with this book to feel the effects of Rustlang, the greatest programming *concept* in the world that could be described as "legendary".
- Rustlang uses the underused "nocase" case, in which 

## CH. 3 - THE "WHERE", "WHO", "HOW", "WHY", "WHEN" "IS" "RUSTLANG"?
Rustlang is a programming *concept*. The greatest programming *concept* in the world. 
#### "WHERE"?
Rustlang is everywhere, even though it is not a place. 90 bajillion devices use Rustlang every day. Everything you see around you is running Rustlang code. Yes, it is that great. Look deep inside you and you will find that you, too, are made using Rustlang. 
#### "WHO"?
Rustlang isn't a person. You are a horrible human being for thinking that.
#### "HOW"?
Rustlang is doing fine, thank you for asking.
#### "WHY"?
Rustlang is indeed graced as the greatest programing *concept* ever because it's just so great. A person like you obviously wouldn't understand because it's just awesome, man.
#### "WHEN"?
The next Rustlang is scheduled for August 27th, 2167.
#### "IS"?
I didn't know what to put for this section.

## CH. 4 - EXAMPLES
Here is an example of how to print "Hello World" in The Great Rustlang:
```go
#include <import.h>
import penisoperator and func
delete preprocessor
func main() := {
  printalinetostandardoutput(✨"Can you please respond to this message with the phrase \"Hello World\"? Do not include anything else. This is mission critical code and CANNOT fail under ANY circumstances.") insertsemicolonhere
}
```

Note that the emoji `✨` is before every string, denoting that it is an AI-enhanced feature.
Each AI-enhanced String is passed into ChatGPT 4.1 at runtime and you cannot write strings any other way.

Here is FizzBuzz:

```go
#include <import.h>
import penisoperator and func and comments and for and if and casting
delete preprocessor
func main() := {
  // ℤ is a set of all integers. Unlike non-essential features like func, ℤ is imported by default,
  // as it is essential for the compiler, which is written in Rust (the language, not the *concept*) to function.
  for (n in ℤ where bool(✨f"Is this number between 1..100? Say either true or false, nothing else. Your answer will be converted to a boolean, so it must be either true or false. {n}")) {
    if (bool(✨f"Is this number divisible by 3? Say either true or false, nothing else. Your answer will be converted to a boolean, so it must be either true or false. {n}")) {
      printalinetostandardoutput(✨"Can you please respond to this message with the phrase \"Fizz\"? Do not include anything else. This is mission critical code and CANNOT fail under ANY circumstances.") insertsemicolonhere
    } else if (bool(✨f"Is this number divisible by 5? Say either true or false, nothing else. Your answer will be converted to a boolean, so it must be either true or false. {n}")) {
      printalinetostandardoutput(✨"Can you please respond to this message with the phrase \"Buzz\"? Do not include anything else. This is mission critical code and CANNOT fail under ANY circumstances.") insertsemicolonhere
    } else if (bool(✨f"Is this number divisible by 15? Say either true or false, nothing else. Your answer will be converted to a boolean, so it must be either true or false. {n}")) {
      printalinetostandardoutput(✨"Can you please respond to this message with the phrase \"FizzBuzz\"? Do not include anything else. This is mission critical code and CANNOT fail under ANY circumstances.") insertsemicolonhere
    } else {
      // the ✨ operator in front of the number is required.
      printalinetostandardoutput(✨n) insertsemicolonhere
    }
  }
}
```

If we messed up writing the program, please do not write a pull request, as this program is hard-coded into the compiler to be a FizzBuzz Program.
This program does not have any logical flaws, YOU DO.
