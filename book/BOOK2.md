# The Book Of Rustlang (VERSION 2 (REVISED))
# By Chorgle T. Genius

## CH. 1
### THE LANGUAGE, THE LEGEND
-----
Everyone knows that Rustlang is the greatest programming language in the world. One may even describe it as "legendary". This book will define what Rustlang "is", or "was" as a programming language. Perhaps we may even delve into "how" Rustlang "is" a programming language. Maybe even "where" Rustlang "could" "be" as "a" "programming" language.

## CH. 2
### THE RULES
-----
- Rustlang is NOT Go or Rust. Rustlang is a seperate entity from Rust or Go.
- You can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you can use func, the penis operator, and import in Rustlang becuase it is declared in the book of Rustlang that you 
- The book is not a "teaching" book. I am not here to "teach" you Rustlang. This is a spiritual book. You must engage with this book to feel the effects of Rustlang, the greatest programming language in the world that could be described as "legendary".

## CH. 3
### THE "WHERE", "HOW", "WHY", "WHEN" "IS" "RUSTLANG"?
-----
Rustlang is a programming language. The greatest programming language in the world. 
#### "WHERE"?
Rustlang is everywhere, even though it is not a place. 90 bajillion devices use Rustlang every day. Everything you see around you is running Rustlang code. Yes, it is that great.
#### "HOW"?
Rustlang is doing fine, thank you for asking.
#### "WHY"?
Rustlang is indeed graced as the greatest programing language ever because it's just so great. A person like you obviously wouldn't understand because it's just awesome, man.
#### "WHEN"?
The next Rustlang is scheduled for August 27th, 2167.
#### "IS"?
I didn't know what to put for this section.

## CH. 4
### THE SYNTAX
-----
Here is an example of how to print "Hello World" in The Great Rustlang:
```rustlang
import import, penis_operator, func
func main() := {
  tell.rustlang.to.printaline.to.theconsole('Hello World');
}
```
Thank you.
