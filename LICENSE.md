Anyone can take this software. Even you can. I'm serious, just take it.
You know what, just do anything you want with it. Change it, share it, burn it, sell it, I don't care what you do with it.

Just don't change this file. This is the one exception, it is critical that THIS IS NOT THE ONE FILE THAT YOU BURN!!!!!

This software is "take-it-or-leave-it". If it has bugs, too bad, it comes exactly as how it is.
This also applies to the law that if you download this software and you use it, it may or may not work perfectly.
We are also not responsible if this somehow breaks your computer. It probably shouldn't (I hope not (actually, it better not)), but just take that into consideration.

The end.
